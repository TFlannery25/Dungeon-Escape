# Dungeon-Escape
2D Platformer

Dungeon Escape is a personal project I developed in 2021. The gameplay includes a player controlled character moving through a 2D world space. The game has 9 main levels with each level featuring various platforms, obstacles, and traps that the player will need to navigate to beat the game. 

# The Player
> The player will control the wizard character in the game using the a and d key to move left and right, and the space bar to jump. When the player jumps they can contorl the movements of the character in the horizontal space as well. If the player comes into contact with various traps they will die.

# Traps 
> 1. Spikes
> Spikes are placed at the bottom of pits and on moving walls and platforms and will kill the player on contact.

> 2. Spinnning Sword
> Swords will be mounted on walls and will rotate either clockwise and counter clockwise and will kill the player on contact.

> 3. Fire Ball
> Fire balls will move back and forth on either a horizontal or vertical plane and will kill the player on contact.

> 4. Homing Axe
> Featured in level 7, the homing axe will slowly move towards the player while spinning and will kill the player on contact.

# Level Failure and Completion
> To complete the level the player will have to find the exit door for the level which on contact will set the GameManager to take them to the transition room that leads to the next level. If the player dies to any trap throughout the level they will start that level over again.
